### Foreground color

the color porperty allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. you can spicify any color in CSS in on of three ways:

3. **Color names** There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. For example: DarkCyan

*CSS3 has also introduced another way to specify colors called HSLA*

*the use of comments can help you to understand a CSS file (and organise it, by splitting a long document into sections). to make notes use /* (note) */

### Background color

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box. 

You can specify you choice of background color in the same three ways.

If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent.

By default, most browser windows have a white background, but users can set a color for their windows.
